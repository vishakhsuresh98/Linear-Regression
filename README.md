# Linear-Regression
An implementation of linear regression in Python 

The air pollutant data for three pollutants (output value Y) -  O3, PM2.5 and SO2 hourly data from the year 2006 to 2015 can be downloaded from the following link:
https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#main-content
(example files : hourly_44201_2015.zip under the Ozone, PM and SO2)

Meteorological data is present in the repository. 

The linear regression task is to predict the values of the air pollutants: Ozone, Sulphur dioxide and particulate matter PM2.5 using the past data for air pollution and meteorological data.
